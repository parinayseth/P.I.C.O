## Patient of 32 years old, Female
- **Duration of Symptoms:**
  - Severe headaches, dizziness, and nausea for the past 2 weeks

- **Detailed Symptoms:**
  - Severe headaches
  - Dizziness
  - Nausea

- **Any Current Medications:**
  - Ibuprofen (occasionally for pain relief)

- **With Medical History:**
  - Diagnosed with hypertension about two years ago
  - Experienced migraines since early twenties

- **Family and Hereditary Conditions:**
  - Mother had migraines
  - Grandfather had hypertension

- **Review of Systems:**
  - Headaches are usually throbbing and can sometimes be constant, often starting as intermittent pain
  - Headaches tend to occur mostly in the late afternoon or after prolonged computer use
  - Stress, lack of sleep, and certain foods (chocolate, cheese) can trigger headaches
  - Visual disturbances (flashing lights or spots) before headaches begin, lasting 10-15 minutes

- **Allergies:**
  - Allergic to penicillin

- **Previous Treatments:**
  - Managing hypertension with medication and lifestyle changes

- **Abnormalities in Report:**
  - Noticed fluctuations in blood pressure, especially when stressed or sleep-deprived

- **Assumption based upon past cases:**
  - A female with episodic, recurrent headache in left hemicranium with nausea and paresthesia in the right upper and lower limbs is most probably suffering from a migraine, specifically classical migraine with aura. 
  - Migraine characteristics: unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, frontotemporal location, aggravation by physical activity, nausea/vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia.
  - Visual aura usually consists of photopsia and scintillation. In some cases, basilar migraine may present with brainstem symptoms.
  - Differential diagnoses:
    - Glossopharyngeal neuralgia: lancinating pain in the throat radiating to the neck, jaw, and ear, triggered by tongue movements or swallowing.
    - Post-herpetic trigeminal pain: associated with history of zoster, constant pain over the trigeminal nerve distribution, and sensory impairment.
    - Brain tumor: prostrating pounding headache with nausea and vomiting, difficult to distinguish from migraine.
  - A 74-year-old woman with occipital headache, vomiting, dizziness, high blood pressure, and altered consciousness might be diagnosed with cerebellar hemorrhage, benefiting from surgical intervention.
